# Lua preprocessor for LÖVE Framework

It's mainly made to be used with löve framework, but if you supply your own filesystem operation functions it can work with any Lua platform.

Quick Implementation
===========
```lua
--Supply filesystem.read. Might return DataStringOrNil, ErrorString  to work
PreProcessor.ReplaceFileSystemReadFunction(love.filesystem.read)

local PreProcessor = require("PreProcessor")
PreProcessor.PrepareEnvironment(_G)

local GeneratedCode = PreProcessor.GenerateCode("MyFile.lua", _G)
local CompiledCode, Err = loadstring(GeneratedCode)

if CompiledCode then
	CompiledCode()
else
	error("Could not compile code. Error: " .. Err)
end
```

The code is based in SimpleLuaPreprocessor so it does share similar syntax when in use such as:

```lua
@for i = 1, 5 do
  print($(i))
@end
```

will compile to

```lua
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
```

This preprocessor supports string and comments blocks, except for the $(code) syntax, it will work anywhere and you must prepare your strings for this as well (or it might be replaced). @line codes will be ignored in comments and string blocks.

There's a built in function for including files, use it

```lua
$(include("path.lua"))
```

Library Functions
===========
```lua
--Supply your own filesystem.read function that returns DataStringOrNil, ErrorString to work on different platforms:
PreProcessor.ReplaceFileSystemReadFunction(Func)
--Use the following function to copy useful functions like include to your preprocessing environment:
PreProcessor.PrepareEnvironment(EnvironmentTable or _G)

--Use this function for preprocessing your code and returning it as a string, the path provided must contain the extension.
StringCode = PreProcessor.GenerateCode(Path, EnvironmentTable or _G)
```
