# Lua code preprocessor for LÖVE Framework

It's mainly made to be used with löve framework, but if you provide your own filesystem operation functions it can work with any Lua platform.

Quick Implementation
===========
```lua
local PreProcessor = require("PreProcessor")
PreProcessor.PrepareEnvironment(_G)

local GeneratedCode = PreProcessor.GenerateCode("MyFile.lua", _G)
local CompiledCode, Err = loadstring(GeneratedCode)

if CompiledCode then
	CompiledCode()
else
	error("Could not compile code. Error: " .. Err)
end
```

The code is based in SimplePreProcessor so it does share similar syntax when in use such as:

```lua
@for i = 1, 5 do
  print($(i))
@end
```

will compile to

```lua
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
```

This preprocessor supports string and comments blocks, except for the $(code) syntax, it will work anywhere and you must prepare your strings for this as well (or it might be replaced). @line codes works with comments and string blocks, it won't run as code if it's inside a string or comment block.

There's a built in function for including files, use it

```lua
$(include("path.lua"))
```

Library Functions
===========
```lua
--Use the following function to copy useful functions like include to your preprocessing environment:
PreProcessor.PrepareEnvironment(EnvironmentTable or _G)

--Use this function for preprocessing your code and returning it as a string, the path provided must contain the extension.
StringCode = PreProcessor.GenerateCode(Path, EnvironmentTable or _G)
```
